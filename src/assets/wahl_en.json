            "answer": "A greater freedom of choice in the main study period (from the 4th semester) enables students to specialise more and to deepen their own interests. Thus, interdisciplinary courses of study can also be improved. Freedom of choice should remain restricted in the basic study period, as this is where the foundations for further education are laid."

            "answer": "Student assistants are also students for the applies. Are not represented in contrast to other employees. In order to be able to include their interests in opinion-forming processes, it is necessary to consider the interests of the student representatives.
