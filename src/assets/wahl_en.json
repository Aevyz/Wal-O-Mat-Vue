Should I repeat an exam five times to get a 1.0 at the end or do I perhaps not have the time or motivation and stick to my 3.3? Likewise, the comparability of the grades would no longer be a factor.

Nevertheless, promoting the cultural interests of students is one of the tasks of the student representation.

In most cases, practical courses require some form of classroom teaching and it is difficult to teach them online. However, even before Corona there were lectures that took place completely online and a didactically meaningful concept was developed for them. Of course this should be allowed to continue to exist!

However, we explicitly demand that exams are not monitored with Proctorio or a similar video system for the detection of cheating. Depending on the format, a digital exam can be useful or not.

On the contrary, it gives you the opportunity to use your time sensibly for areas that you have not yet internalized well and thus not only achieve better examination results, but also a better understanding of the subject. In addition, many students are currently crossing out their exams if they feel that things are not going well. This slows down their progress and also increases the number of exam registrations.

However, it is worrying that this right is no longer granted. Rights shouldn't be privileges. Furthermore, this right exists in all other federal states. Therefore, we demand this right for general political statements back, but not to make regular or excessive use of it."

Just think of the semester ticket or the students' houses. As work in some university committees (such as the Senate) is not public, it is often difficult to communicate specific content here. Nevertheless, information about their own work should be provided in as many places as possible as transparently as possible. Unfortunately, in some cases, even the internal communication is not good enough. Transparency and communication are the most important premises of political representation."

            "answer": "A topic-related and solution-oriented work is really important, especially in university politics. Most of the changes that have been initiated will not go into effect until two years later, which makes communication and collaboration so essential. A directly elected parliament would certainly be desirable in terms of democratic theory, but approaches to university policy issues are not incredibly heterogeneous, since it is often very clear that something like a StudiTUM house, for example, or the semester ticket is a good thing for most students. However, a direct election through lists would lead to factions and a kind of party politics, which leads to less substantive work. In addition, the student council has created an indirectly elected parliament, which through the participation of all student councils ensures that every faculty and every location is well represented."

            "answer": "In the course of the '68 movement, the student representative bodies in Bavaria were deprived of their general political mandate, as well as that of a constituted student body. The constituted student body makes you legally a lot more independent, since a student representation is legally located in the organizational chart under the University Presidium. This reinforces the already existing David against Goliath position, especially when it comes, for example, to the expenses of the study grants, which are actually earmarked and should serve to improve teaching. TUM has enough money not to pay for construction work from this pot. Rights should not be privileges, which is why it would be important to reintroduce the constituted student body. Above all, to emancipate yourself from the university board and to be able to represent the students independently. There are also constituted student bodies in all other federal states of Germany."

No other university has such large, well-planned festivals thanks to its student representation. Our event technology department also supports the LMU Summer Festival every year. In terms of time, most people are more involved either in the area of university policy or in the area of events. This is easy to explain with inclination and interest, so they are not resources that you could or would otherwise involve. Events from our environmental department or the department for diversity and queer are sometimes also co-financed by the festival's income."

It would be great if it resulted in profitable, great initiatives. The student council also supported the 'Radentscheid', for example, and the student representative body actively collected signatures for it. The cooperation should be subject-related, because there are still two different areas and Fridays for Future are not elected by the students, so it is important to always recognize the students' right of representation as the most important obligation."
